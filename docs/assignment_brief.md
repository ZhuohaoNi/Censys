Censys 2026 Summer Internship Take Home Exercise 

AI Engineer Intern Take-Home Project: Censys Data Summarization Agent

Project Overview
This take-home project is designed for AI Engineer intern candidates. It is a full-stack project that encourages the use of AI techniques to create a small agent. The project should be completed within approximately 4 hours. We strongly encourage the use of AI tools (e.g., coding copilots, LLMs, or automation techniques), as these are core to how we build and operate in our day-to-day work

Project Description
Develop a small AI agentic application that can summarize Censys data. We will provide a sample dataset for this project.

Requirements
Full-Stack Implementation: The project should demonstrate both frontend and backend components.
AI Integration: Candidates are encouraged to leverage LLM for the summarization task.
Summarization Output: The agent should generate concise summaries of host data (provided).
User Interface: A simple UI to interact with the agent (e.g., input data, view summaries) is required. While it does not need to be fully polished, it should demonstrate how a user would interact with the system. 
Deliverables
Code Submission: All source code should be uploaded to a publicly accessible GitHub or Bitbucket account.
README File: A comprehensive README.md file should be included in the repository with the following:
Instructions on how to run the project.
Any assumptions made during development.
Simple testing instructions (manual or automated).
A brief description of the implemented AI techniques.
Future Enhancements List: A list detailing what you would do if given more time to work on this project.
Evaluation Criteria
We will be assessing the following:

 

Functional Correctness: Does the agent correctly summarize the provided data?
Prompt Engineering: How do you build the best prompt for the use case, and how well-structured is your prompt?
Code Quality: Readability, maintainability, and organization of the code.
Documentation: Clarity and completeness of the README file, including setup and testing instructions.
Extensibility: The potential for adding new features or improving existing ones (as demonstrated by your "Future Enhancements" list).
